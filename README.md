Hi! First I would like to thank you very much for the opportunity!
I've worked hard on the project for the last 3 days because I wanted to show my ability beyond simple html+css design for the form you have given me.
Thats why I took the time to learn Angular, and implemented 3 different features:

1. MultiPage: A component that allows to easily divide content into separate pages. 
It include 3 different optional nav components:
 - nav-tabs: navigate between pages with a tab UI
 - nav-dropdown: use a dropdown list of all pages to navigate
 - show-all-button: shows all pages at once.
 
2. Local Data Saving: while filling the form, the progress is automatically saved locally on the computer. You can exit the site and it will be kept.
3. Validation: I did not have the time to apply validation to the entire form (It is very long ðŸ˜…) But It is available, including regular expressions for some of the fields.

In addition, I have put my design in your site template, to show how it would look. I used Githup Pages to host the site and let you see it in action.
The repository is also public on GitHub for you to look at the code.

Thank You,
